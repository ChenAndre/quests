Challenge(10's complement)

Fill in social security number to a person in an alien planet.

5 digits long(5 boxes to fill in)

There are only 4000 on the planet

Unfortunately, some of the social security numbers are negative and some are possible

We solve this by defining a cool thing called "10's complement." The idea is suppose we want to represent the negative number -703. (Aidens number). We find a corresponding number, which when added to 703 gives you all 0's in just the 5 boxes. 

 00703
+xxxxx =
x00000

Find the number which when added to 00703 results in 99999
Which is gonna be 99296

Then add 1 to it. That will give you the number, that when added to 00703 results in 100000.

Then we can toss out the 1 in the 1xxxxx because it doesn't fit n the 5 boxes. 

This is interesting because we found a number that, when added to 00703, is 0. Who cares about the negative we are talking about getting the 0's in the 5 boxes.

Since we have found a number that results in 0 when added to 00703, we have found the negative of 00703.

Therefore, we treat -703 as 99297. Because when you added 99297 to 703 you get all 0's.

Observe 10's complement method:



Now we will try to do 2's complement(perhaps using bits after doing binary number system):

In class 10's compliment. 


2's compliment
We want to convert the number -75 to binary using 8 bits(one byte):

01001011 is +75 in 8 bits

Let's verify by adding the two's compliment to the positive-numer (+75) and see if we get all 0

 10110101 -- two's complement
+01001011 -- original number (75)
*only put the rightmost digits and the left digits are carried over.
= 00000000 -- there is one carried leftmost digit that does not fit and will be discarded

The challenge is to represent a fractional number like 0.0625
So first we will begin by doing it in decimal
Challenge: Represent .0625 in ten boxes using 0-9 only.

We will rewrite 0.0625 as 625*(10^-5)
So then we will just put the number as 00625 no decimal point
so we have 00625 
Let's start by converting 5 to -5 in Two's complement using 4 boxes. 
s
Converting 5 to binary will get you 0101
1010-1's complement of 5
Adding 1 to that will give the 2's complement - 1011

Verifying -- 
	0101
       +1011   =
	0000

Different types of binary depending on complement : ex: 1's complement bninary. 2's complement binary, etc
